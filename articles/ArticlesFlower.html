      <h1 class="article-title">Flowers</h1>
      <p class="article-p">From a scientific point of view, a flower is a system of organs of seed reproduction of flowering plants. The flower is a modified, shortened and limited in growth spore-bearing shoot, adapted for the formation of spores and gametes, as well as for the sexual process, culminating in the formation of a fruit with seeds. The exclusive role of the flower as a special morphological structure is due to the fact that it completely combines all the processes of asexual and sexual reproduction.</p>
      <p class="article-p">But for humans, flowers are more than a system of organs of seed reproduction. Flowers are one of the best creations of nature. They amaze us with the finest aromas, delight us with a wide variety of shades. They, like music, create high spirits. Since ancient times, they have been for a person a symbol of his feelings, thoughts.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Probably every girl in the world wants to be bombarded with flowers every day by her secret admirers, boyfriend or beloved husband. Flowers have a special effect on girls, and therefore every man knows that flowers are one of the main points of a successful date.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Babies from the maternity hospital are greeted with flowers, flowers are presented for celebrations, rooms and holidays are decorated with them, the bride is always with flowers. We are accustomed to this custom and sincerely rejoice at such a gift. So where did the tradition of giving flowers come from? Perhaps the most beautiful and touching version of the emergence of the tradition of giving flowers can be called the legend of Adam and Eve. It is believed that after the expulsion from Eden (the Garden of Eden, which is considered the original habitat of people), most of all Eve yearned for the beauties of the garden and, especially, for its flowers. Adam wanted to please Eve and make the environment on Earth at least a little like Eden. He searched for a long time how to do this and came across a clearing full of beautiful and fragrant flowers. Adam collected a huge bouquet and presented it to Eve. Since then, the tradition of giving flowers to women has appeared, many believe. There is also another popular theory about the origin of this custom. The theory says that all flower traditions originated in the courts of European rulers. In the Middle Ages, under kings and emperors, there were specially trained gardeners who were responsible for the beauty of the royal garden and for decorating the premises of the palace with flowers. They not only studied the art of growing flowers, but also knew the "language of flowers" in order to decorate the premises with those shades of flowers that best correspond to a particular event.</p>
      <p class="article-p">People, as a rule, even just looking at flowers, get great pleasure, good mood and a feeling of contact with beauty.</p>
