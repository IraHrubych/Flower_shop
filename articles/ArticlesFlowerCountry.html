      <h1 class="article-title">The meanings of flowers in the cultures of the countries of the world</h1>
      <p class="article-p">China. And so, let's start with the Middle Kingdom. The most important thing to remember if you decide to go to China is never give white flowers to anyone. The white inflorescence for the Chinese symbolizes death. Also, mainly Chinese people give each other artificial flowers. This does not mean that the Chinese do not like living plants, but when a living flower is plucked, it will quickly wither, and again will symbolize death. You can also note the event of a national scale - the festival of peonies. The festival takes place everywhere in all regions of the country. During the festival, a large number of fairs and concerts are held, where residents present various works in the form of embroidery or paintings with peonies. Also, young couples like to conclude a family union during the festival.</p>
      <p class="article-p">France. There is a black pond in the count's park, there lilies bloom, there lilies bloom, bloom... A very sophisticated flower, a symbol of the French ruling dynasty of monarchs. A flower mentioned in the Song of King Solomon. Of course, it is the lily that is the generally accepted symbol of France and is most revered among the French. Lily will be an appropriate gift for absolutely anyone at an event of any level. Scarlet roses, just like in Ukraine, are considered a symbol of love and passion, but yellow flowers are a symbol of treason. True, to be honest, it is not entirely clear what is the point of giving yellow flowers if they carry a negative connotation. Like, "Honey, I cheated on you, hold the bouquet?"</p>
      <p class="article-p">Japan. The Japanese even created their own special flower language called Hanakotoba. Unfortunately, in the modern world, the younger generation of Japanese no longer remembers the meaning of many colors. However, the adult generation does not let the history of their country be forgotten by filming anime and manga that talk about the language of flowers. So from 1979 to the present, the popular TV series “Lulu - the Angel of Flowers” ​​has been running, in each episode of which they talk about the meaning of the plant to which the series is dedicated. We will give an example of some of the most famous meanings of flowers from Hanakotoba: a red rose, like a red carnation, means romantic love, a white rose symbolizes innocence and devotion, the meaning of a red tulip is glory, a bell is given as a token of gratitude, and white chrysanthemums, which denote sadness, are usually given to the funeral. In Japan, as in many other Asian countries, it is considered offensive to give cut flowers to a wedding. But unlike the artificial plants favored in China, the Japanese love real flowers in pots. If, for any reason, you decide to give cut flowers, there should be an even number of buds in the bouquet, but giving 4 buds is prohibited, this number in Japan is a symbol of death.</p>
      <p class="article-p">India. In fact, the inhabitants of India attach any religious or hidden meaning to any flower. However, the most revered is certainly the lotus. The lotus in Hinduism is considered as important a symbol as, for example, the cross is in Christianity. Most of the supreme gods of India are often depicted with a magnificent lotus flower. The image of the lotus can be found in temples, literature, ancient frescoes and bas-reliefs. The deceased is escorted to another world along with a lotus flower, which symbolizes resurrection after death. In addition to spiritual significance, the lotus has important healing properties. It is used as an antiseptic, they treat many diseases and drink decoctions on the flower, due to their tonic properties.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Finland. Finns are very careful about nature and love nature. Finnish cities are practically empty in the summer, because all the inhabitants leave for the countryside. The national flower in Finland is the lily of the valley. It was very often used by Finnish poets as an image of romanticism, and even now quite a few songs are composed about the lily of the valley. The Finns absolutely do not care how many buds are in the bouquet. Therefore, you can safely give a bouquet, both with an even and an odd number of flowers. The people of Finland celebrate Mother's Day, on which they usually give their parents ikebanas and bouquets of artificial orchids.</p>
